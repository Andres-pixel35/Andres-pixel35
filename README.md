# Hi there!

I am Andres, a Data Scientist and Chinese student based in Colombia

I mostly work in project that either you can deploy in your own device and modified to meet you needs or in Data Anlysis.

In this profile I mainly updated my personal projects and analysis. Everything here is built on my own from scratch, no copy/paste or templates.

Last project: Data Anlysis on Isekai.

Currently working in an App/web (not sure yet) where the user can insert the anime, mangas or light novels they have watched and generate a new CSV with those works plus other data and with that create a dashboard.
